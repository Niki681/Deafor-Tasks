Build an e-commerce application that sells different types of products with varying properties,
 such as price, size, and color. The application should use inheritance to create a base product 
 class that contains the shared properties and methods of all products, and then create subclasses 
 that inherit from the base class and add their own unique properties and methods.

To accomplish this, you should start by creating a Product class with properties such as 
price, size, and color. This class should also contain methods that all products will have,
 such as a method to display the product information.

Next, you should create subclasses for each type of product that you want to sell,
 such as Clothing, Electronics, or Books. These subclasses should inherit from 
 the Product class and add their own unique properties and methods. 
 For example, the Clothing class might have a size property and a method to calculate 
 the appropriate size based on the user's measurements.

Once you have created the necessary classes, you can use them to create 
instances of each product type in your e-commerce application. 
You should provide a way for users to view the available products, add them to a shopping cart, and make a purchase.

This task will help you understand how to use inheritance in JavaScript 
to create classes with shared properties and methods, as well as how to create 
subclasses that inherit from a base class and add their own unique properties and methods.
 It will also give you practice in building a simple e-commerce application, which is a common
  use case for web development.
